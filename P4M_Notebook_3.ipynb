        "1.  Create functions `redprimes_upto(x)` and `blueprimes_upto(x)` which count the number of red/blue primes up to a given number `x`.  Recall that we defined red/blue primes to be those of the form 4n+1 or 4n+3, respectively.  Graph the relative proportion of red/blue primes as `x` varies from 1 to 1 million.  E.g., are the proportions 50%/50% or 70%/30%, and how do these proportions change?  Note:  this is also visualized in [An Illustrated Theory of Numbers](http://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-105) and you can read [an article by Rubinstein and Sarnak](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1048515870) for more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Does there seem to be a bias in the last digits of primes?  Note that, except for 2 and 5, every prime ends in 1,3,7, or 9.  Note: the last digit of a number `n` is obtained from `n % 10`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Read about the [\"Prime Conspiracy\"](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-discover-prime-conspiracy-20160313), recently discovered by Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan.  Can you detect their conspiracy in our data set of primes?"

Hence a proclivity amongst primes to not be followed by a prime with the same last digit is visible in this function's outputs."
